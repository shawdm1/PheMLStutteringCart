Phecode based stuttering case prediction machine learning model (PheML)

PheML is a classification and regression tree that uses commonly observed stuttering comobidities to impute the stuttering phenotype in subjects
Scripts requres two arguments:
	-i: Input phecode file (see formatting below)
	-o: Output file name

Phecode file format:
Scripts expects header (column titles are irrelevant), not having header line will simply cause the script to skip the first phecode
Phecode file should have at least two columns. The first should have the sample id, and the second should have the phecode
Additional columns are fine as they will simply be ignored by the script


EXAMPLE:
SAMPLE_ID,PHECODE
sample_1,290.1
sample_1,301.1
sample_1,211.1
sample_2,100.1
sample_2,150.3
...



Script requires the follow packages (also includes versions script was tested in, other versions may work):

numpy 1.17
sklearn 0.24
joblib 1.0.1




model folder includes enrichment features used in script and CART model the script will load through joblib

Script only returns one file: sample list of all samples that were predicted to stutter based on PheML CART model
